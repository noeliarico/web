# Basic functions I

</br>

## Belief

$$Bel(A)=\sum_{S\subseteq A} m(S)$$

</br>

## Plausibility

$$Pl(A)=\sum_{S \cap A \neq \emptyset} m(S)$$

---

# Basic functions II

</br>

## Dempster's combination rule

$$m_{1,2}(A) = \frac{1}{1-Z} \sum\limits_{B \cap C = A} m_1(B) \cdot m_2(C)$$
where

$$Z = \sum\limits_{B \cap C = \emptyset} m_1(B) \cdot m_2(C)$$

is a measure of *conflict* between the two basic probability assignment sets. In addition, $m_{1,2}(\emptyset) = 0$ by definition.

# New software based on GPU

- Compute the functions in parallel

## Why Python?

- Numba package for CUDA
- Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)

# Execution time

Three different algorithms:

- Executed on the CPU
  - `AlgIPy`
  - `AlgCPy`
- Executed on the GPU
  - `AlgGPU`
  
  <br/><br/>
  
Execution times obtained with each of the algorithms:

# Execution time combination rule


- Each thread evaluates, in parallel, one of the different pairs of focal elements $\{(B,C)\,|\,B \in F_{m_1}(\Omega) \land C \in F_{m_2}(\Omega)\}$, computing its intersection as well as the corresponding result obtained from $m_1(B) \cdot m_2(C)$.
- Then, one single thread goes sequentially over all the obtained intersections, grouping the ones that represent the same focal element in order to create the resulting focal set $F_3(\Omega)$ and the corresponding basic probabilities assignment of the focal elements.
- The threads are again used to divide in parallel the summed masses obtained for all $A \in F_3(\Omega)$ by $1-Z$.
